## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Could not download Nifty 50 list"**
   - **Solution**: Application will use fallback list automatically
   - **Cause**: NSE server connectivity issues

2. **"No stocks met the criteria"**
   - **Solution**: Relax filter parameters in sidebar
   - **Cause**: Too restrictive filtering criteria

3. **Slow data loading**
   - **Solution**: Wait for caching to complete on first run
   - **Cause**: Initial data fetching from multiple sources

4. **Module not found errors**
   - **Solution**: Ensure all requirements are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Performance Tips

- **First Run**: May take 2-3 minutes to fetch all Nifty 50 data
- **Subsequent Runs**: Much faster due to caching
- **Internet Connection**: Stable connection required for real-time data
- **Browser**: Use modern browsers for best experience
